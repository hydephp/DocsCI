                            This blog post will guide you through creating a new
                            Hyde site, while also showcasing some neat features!
                        </p>
                        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
                        <p>
                            This guide assumes you have Composer and NPM
                            installed. You also need PHP 8 or higher. Previous
                            command-line experience won't hurt either since we
                            will be using the CLI a lot! I'm using Windows
                            PowerShell here, but you can follow along with Bash
                            as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This guide will mostly be example-driven. If you
                            have any questions, please send me a tweet! I'm

                        <h2>Creating a new project</h2>
                        <p>
                            Creating a site with Hyde is easy, especially when
                            using Composer!
                        </p>
                        <pre><code class="language-bash">composer create-project hyde/hyde tutorial-demo
</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            CD into the created directory using
                            <code>cd tutorial demo</code>
                        </p>
                        <p>Right away you can run the build command</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-bash">php hyde build
</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            and open the generated HTML page that is stored as
                            <code>index.html</code> in the
                            <code>_site</code> directory. Let's take a look!
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Amazing! We probably don't want to keep this welcome
                            screen though. Let's create a blog!
                        </p>
                        <h2>Setting up the blog homepage</h2>
                        <p>
                            Hyde comes with a built-in blog module. First, let's
                            change our homepage!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hyde comes with a few different options to use as
                            the index.html. The one we have right now, the
                            default, is called 'welcome'.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We can change our homepage using the Hyde command
                            which will present us with a few options. We'll
                            select the one named 'post feed'. Since we already
                            have a homepage we need to add the --force flag to
                            allow it to be overwritten. This is a safeguard in
                            case you have changed the file yourself.
                        </p>
                        <pre><code class="language-bash">php hyde publish:homepage --force
</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            We will be asked if we want to rebuild the site,
                            let's hit 'yes' and take a look!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <img
                                src="../media/screely-1648242979072-min.png"
                                alt="Screenshot of welcome page"
                            />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cool! Though it looks a bit empty. Let's create a
                            post!
                        </p>
                        <h2>Creating a blog post</h2>
                        <p>
                            Blog posts are based on Markdown files with metadata
                            (post information) specified in a special YAML
                            called Front Matter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We can of course create the file manually but that
                            is so old fashioned. Instead, let's use the
                            interactive command to scaffold it for us!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The command we are using is the
                            <code>php hyde make:post</code> command, which gives
                            asks us for input and then generates the boring
                            stuff for us.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here is what the output looks like: ![Screenshot of
                            command output](../media/Screenshot 2022-03-25

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let's take a look at the file that was created for
                            us! As you can see it is stored in the
                            <code>_posts</code> directory. A slug was
                            automatically created from the title and the date
                            was automatically parsed from the current time.

                            As you can see, the excerpt automatically shows up
                            in the feed on the homepage! I also added some extra
                            text in the Markdown section.

                        <h2>Creating a custom Markdown page</h2>
                        <p>
                            Now that we have a nice blog post, why not try our
                            hand at creating an about us page?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hyde allows the creation of simple Markdown based
                            pages. Markdown files in the
                            <code>_pages</code> directory are automatically
                            compiled into static HTML.
                        </p>
                        <p>Let's try it!</p>
                        <p>
                            I'll use the command line to create the file. We
                            need to add a block of front matter with the page
                            title.

                        <p>
                            If you have a keen eye, you will see that a link to
                            the page has been added to the navigation menu!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is all well and good, but it's getting a bit
                            tedious to have to go back to the terminal and rerun
                            the build command all the time. Wouldn't it be nice
                            if Hyde could automatically rebuild the site for us?
                            Oh, it can? Yup, Hyde has a real-time compiler that
                            we have to try out!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The real-time compiler -- let's call it

                            sounds cool -- uses a few NPM modules, so first we
                            should install the dependencies. Make sure you have
                            Node and NPM installed!

                            A window in your default browser should now open up
                            automatically. If not, just navigate to
                            <a href="http://localhost:3000/"

                            Let's go back to our blog post and change the text.
                            Once you hit save the site will automatically
                            rebuild and the browser window will be updated
                            without you even having to reload! It's a bit hard
                            to illustrate this behaviour in text, so be sure to
                            try it out yourself!

                        <h2>Let's create a Blade Page!</h2>
                        <p>
                            I'm getting a bit bored of the Markdown About Us
                            page we created earlier. Let's swap it out with a
                            page based on a Blade view!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Creating Blade pages is similar to creating Markdown
                            pages, but instead of saving a Markdown file in the
                            <code>_posts</code> directory we create a file
                            ending in .blade.php in the
                            <code>resources/views/pages</code> directory.
                        </p>
                        <p>Let's create the file using the CLI.</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-bash">touch resources/views/pages/about-us.blade.php
</code></pre>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                By the way, this is the same directory where we
                                have the index.blade.php file which is the
                                homepage file.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            Blade files take precedence over Markdown files as
                            they are compiled later in the build process, so if
                            you go to the about-us.html you should see a blank
                            page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When writing Blade pages you have a few options
                            since we can utilize the full power Laravel brings
                            us. If you want you can skip using Blade and just
                            write pure HTML (like the welcome page), or you can
                            use Blade templates and components (like the post
                            feed page). I'm going to extend the default layout
                            so Hyde can automatically inject the proper
                            stylesheets etc. Feel free to use the code below to
                            kickstart creating your custom Blade page!
                        </p>
                        <pre><code class="language-blade">@extends('hyde::layouts.app')
@section('content')
@php($title = &quot;My Custom Title&quot;) {{-- This is optional, but lets us set the page title --}}

// Place content here

                            I'll be uploading this tutorial repo to GitHub so
                            you can take a look at the Blade page. I'm renaming
                            it to blade.blade.php though.

                        <h2>Document the documentation!</h2>
                        <p>
                            Documentation is important! If a feature is not
                            documented, it does not exist! &quot;But writing
                            documentation is soooo boring&quot; you might say,
                            and to that, I say, &quot;not with Hyde!&quot;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You heard me! Writing documentation is fun again!
                            Best of all? It is dead simple.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Hyde Docgen module is based on Laradocgen and
                            automagically turns Markdown pages into
                            documentation pages. They are what powers the Hyde
                            documentation site!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Creating documentation pages are a piece of cake. We
                            start by creating a file following the format of
                            kebab-case-version-of-the-title.md in the
                            <code>_docs</code> directory.
                        </p>
                        <pre><code class="language-bash">echo &quot;# Hello World!&quot; &gt; _docs/hello-world.md
</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            We can now take a look at
                            <a
                                href="http://localhost:3000/docs/hello-world.html"
                                >http://localhost:3000/docs/hello-world.html</a
                            >
                            where we should have a nice page waiting for us!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The sidebar will like magic be populated with all
                            the documentation pages. The page titles in the
                            sidebar are generated from the filename, and the
                            HTML page title is inferred from the first H1 tag.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Wanna know another cool thing? If you create a file
                            in the <code>_docs</code> directory named index.md
                            or readme.md a link labelled docs linking to it will
                            be added automatically to the main navigation menu!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And if you create an index.md file here, which is
                            recommended, it will be not be shown as a link in
                            the sidebar but instead, the header in the sidebar
                            will link to it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Our documentation is cool and all that, but I want
                            to add lots of code examples, but they look so
                            boring without syntax highlighting...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <img

                            />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hyde has built-in support for one of my favourite
                            packages, Torchlight, which is free for open source
                            and non-commercial projects and requires an
                            attribution link, which Hyde injects automatically
                            on pages that use Torchlight!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To get started you need an API token from Torchlight
                            which you can get for free on their website:
                            <a href="https://torchlight.dev/"
                                >https://torchlight.dev/</a
                            >
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once you have the token you need to set it in your
                            dotenv file. If you don't have one you can copy the
                            example file supplied with the project using this
                            command (or by renaming/copying it manually)
                        </p>
                        <pre><code class="language-bash">cp .env.example .env
</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            Then in the .env file, add your API token like so:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code class="language-bash">TORCHLIGHT_TOKEN=torch_abcdefg123
</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            Adding the token makes Hyde automatically enable the
                            Torchlight extension.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now when we run the build command you will notice it
                            takes a bit longer, especially the first time, but
                            no sweat because we got ourselves some beautiful
