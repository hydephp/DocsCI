HydePHP is a Static Site Builder focused on making Blog posts easy and fun. Under the hood, it is powered by Laravel Zero which is a stripped-down version of the robust Laravel Framework. Using Blade templates the site is intelligently compiled into static HTML. Content is created using Markdown, which supports YAML Front Matter.

Hyde is inspired by JekyllRB and is created for Developers who are comfortable writing posts in Markdown. It requires virtually no configuration out of the box as it favours convention over configuration. Though you can easily modify settings in the config/hyde.php to personalize your site. You can also directly modify the Blade views to make them truly yours.

The frontend uses a lightweight minimalist layout built with TailwindCSS which you can extend with the Blade components.

Hyde is designed to be stupidly simple to get started with, while also remaining easily hackable and extendable.

## Live Demo
The Hyde site (https://hydephp.github.io/) is fully built with Hyde. That includes the homepage, the blog, and the [documentation](https://hydephp.github.io/docs/master/index.html)!

## Installation
> Full installation guide is in the documentation at https://hydephp.github.io/docs/

The recommended method of installation is using Composer. However, if you want to run the latest development version you can clone the Git repo, see the [full docs](https://hydephp.github.io/docs/master/installation.html) for instructions.

### Using Composer (recommended)
```bash
composer create-project hyde/hyde --stability=dev

cd hyde
npm install && npm run dev
```

### Requirements 
> These requirements are for your local development environment. The static HTML can be hosted virtually anywhere, including on GitHub Pages.
Hyde uses Laravel 9 which requires PHP >= 8.0. You should also have Composer and NPM installed.


## Getting Started
It's a breeze to get started. Simply clone the repository, write your Markdown posts and save them to the `_posts` directory and run the `php hyde build` command. You can scaffold post files using the `php hyde make:post` command.

### Usage
Hyde scans the source directories prefixed with _underscores for Markdown files and intelligently compiles them into static HTML using Blade templates. The site is then saved in _docs.

Hyde is "blog and documentation aware" and has built-in templates for both blogging and for creating beautiful documentation pages based on Laradocgen. Since Hyde is modular you can of course disable the modules you don't need.

The full usage guide is in the documentation at https://hydephp.github.io/docs/

#### Building the static site

Then to compile the site into static HTML all you have to do is execute the Hyde build command.
```bash
php hyde build
```

Your site will then be saved in the `_site` directory, which you can then upload to your static web host.
All links use relative paths, so you can deploy to a subdirectory without any problems which also makes the site work great when browsing the HTML files locally even without a web server.

If it is the first time building the site or if you have updated the source SCSS you also need to run `npm install && npm run dev` to build the frontend assets.

### Live preview
Use `npm run watch` to watch the files for changes and start up a local dev server on port 3000 using Browsersync.

### NPM Commands
See all commands in the documentation [Console Commands](https://hydephp.github.io/docs/master/console-commands.html)

## Hacking Hyde
Hyde is designed to be easy to use and easy to customize and hack. You can modify the source views and SCSS, customize the Tailwind config, and you can even create 100% custom HTML and Blade pages that get compiled into static HTML.

While Hyde favours "convention over configuration" there are a few config options in the `config/hyde.php` file. All settings are prefilled with sensible defaults so you don't need to configure anything unless you want to!

## Extensions
Hyde comes with built-in support for Torchlight Syntax Highlighting.
All you need to do is to set your API token in your .env file and
Hyde will automatically enable the CommonMark extension.

> Note that when using Torchlight the pages will take longer to generate as API calls need to be made.
> However, Torchlight caches the response so this only affects the first time running the build, or if you update the page.

## Known Issues
Hyde does not automatically delete compiled HTML files when the source files have been removed. 
However, you can supply the `--clean` flag to remove all content in the `_site` directory when running the build command.

Currently, only top-level custom pages are supported. In the future, nested pages will be supported.
For example, _site/directory/page.html
