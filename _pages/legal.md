# Legal Information

To keep things nice and friendly for everyone, here is some stuff to keep in mind.
I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. 

## Website Privacy, Cookies, and Analytics

Your privacy and security matters. This website does not use cookies or tracking technologies.[^1] 

The only information stored when using this site is your preference for using the dark theme.
This is done using LocalStorage and is stored in your browser, allowing the site to keep
your theme preference selected.

We get basic analytics from GitHub where this site is hosted. The DNS provider also provides
some statistics. These statistics are completely anonymous and we cannot trace, track, or 
link any of the data to any individual. Please see the respective providers web sites 
for more information on how they handle data.


[^1]: While we do not use cookies on our side (since this is a static site without a backend),
      some external services may use cookies, for example if a YouTube video is embedded.

### Ticker analytics (June 2022)
Since mid-June, HydePHP.com is testing an analytics service from Pioneer.app called Ticker
to collect anonymous page view statistics. See Pioneer's privacy policy at https://pioneer.app/privacy.
